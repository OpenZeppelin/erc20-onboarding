# ERC20 opt-in onboarding

**This code uses an old version of the OpenZeppelin SDK, named ZeppelinOS. Nonetheless, the instructions in the documentation still apply.**

This is a sample project illustrating how a regular ERC20 token can be migrated to an upgradeable ERC20 using the OpenZeppelin SDK. Please follow our [official documentation](https://docs.zeppelinos.org/docs/erc20_onboarding.html) to better understand how to onboard your token to the OpenZeppelin SDK.
